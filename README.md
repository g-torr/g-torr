# Welcome to my Github page :dizzy: 
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Giuseppe Torrisi, I am a Reseach Fellow  at the University of Edinburgh :uk:
I have completed my PhD in Applied Mathematics at King's College London.
## :mag: What my research is about
I am part a global effort of [Delta Leap](wellcomeleap.org/delta-tissue/) to predict  which patients will respond to chemotherapy and why. As part of the [Schumacher group](https://github.com/Schumacher-group), I help developing the computational methods used to analyse the data generated by the experimental teams from patients with Triple Negative Breast Cancer. In the analysis, I contribute through different ML algorithms for visualisation, clustering and predictions. 

Furthermore, I am interested in modelling of gene regulatory networks, I ask questions like "What are the key features that makes gene regulation so precise and effective?"
This investigation requires a multidisciplinary approach and I develop mathematical modelling.  My research interests include network theory and statistical mechanics.
## What you can find here
Openess and transparency in research are very important, the code to reproduce my research papers is here!

I had some fun coding as well! :gift: Have you ever wondered how to recycle gifts you don't like to your friends without being caught? Well, [here](https://github.com/g-torr/recycle_gift) there is an implementation using genetic algorithms.
## :computer: What languages can you expect to find here
I code mainly in Python,  but here you can find also code in Matlab and  CUDA C.
