# Welcome to my Github page :dizzy: 
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Giuseppe Torrisi, I am a PhD student in Applied Mathematics :bar_chart: :pencil2::notebook: at King's College London! :uk:
## What's your research about?
I am interested in modelling of gene regulatory networks, I ask questions:thinking: like "What are the key features that makes gene regulation so precise and effective:question::question:"


I don't know it yet ðŸ˜œ, but I use maths to try to answer:grey_exclamation: I use network theory and explore the dynamics of Boolean networks.
## What can I find here?
Openess and transparency in research are very important, the code to reproduce my research is here! If you are interested about the paper [Percolation on the gene regulatory network](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-5468/aba7b0), have a look at [the repository](https://github.com/g-torr/percolation-grn)  

I had some fun coding as well!  Have you ever wondered how to recycle gifts you don't like to your friends without being caught?:gift: Well, here it is an implementation using genetic algorithm, have a look [here](https://github.com/g-torr/recycle_gift)
## What languages do you code in :computer:?
Here you fill find mainly code in Python,  but also in Matlab and even in CUDA C.
## I want to know more about your research
