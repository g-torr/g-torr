# Welcome to my Github page :dizzy: 
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Giuseppe Torrisi, I am a PhD student in Applied Mathematics :bar_chart: :pencil2::notebook: at King's College London! :uk:
## :mag: What my research is about
I am interested in modelling of gene regulatory networks,:thinking: I ask questions like "What are the key features that makes gene regulation so precise and effective:question::question:"


The answer requires a multidisciplinary approach, I develop mathematical modelling to try to answer:grey_exclamation: My field of research includes network theory and Boolean network dynamics.
## What you can find here
Openess and transparency in research are very important, the code to reproduce my research is here!

I had some fun coding as well! :gift: Have you ever wondered how to recycle gifts you don't like to your friends without being caught? Well, [here](https://github.com/g-torr/recycle_gift) there is an implementation using genetic algorithms.
## :computer: What languages can you expect to find here
I code mainly in Python,  but here you can find also code in Matlab and  CUDA C.
## ðŸ“« How to know more about my research or to reach me
Here is  [the link to my Google Scholar account](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ZI00mzcAAAAJ) and get updated with latest news from the [Disordered Systems Group website](https://dissyskcl.github.io/).
 :dancers: Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the integration of models with data.:raising_hand: If you have any comments, ideas, or just to discuss,  please reach me via email :email: giuseppe.torrisi@kcl.ac.uk
